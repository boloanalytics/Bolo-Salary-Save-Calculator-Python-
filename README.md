# Bolo-Salary-Save-Calculator-Python-
This calculator was initially created on a Microsoft Excel. 
The whole idea is to be able to save a certain percentage of monthly net salary, and from that savings, be able to increase your salary after a year.
Say % saved from monthly net salary is X, and annual net is Y
Then (X * 12) which Z forms the annual saved in a single year.
40% (Static) of Z is then added to the coming yearly net (nY) to nY+
nY+ divided by 12 will then be the new salary net that the person starts to earn.
